## Introduction

In this project, we explore the use of an Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT) to accelerate virus detection. The IBLT is a data structure that allows for efficient set reconciliation, which is useful in scenarios where two sets of data need to be compared and the differences identified.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/7396_Virus_Detection_Acceleration_Project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To run the virus detection acceleration program, execute the following command:
