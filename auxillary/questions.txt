Questions for Alon:

	Q1: How should we represent the exact match string(s)?
		For example: In content we may have: |00 00 72 ...|, should we keep an array of each char ([' ', ',',...]),
			including special chars like '00'? Or should we keep them in an array of int ([00, 72, ...]).

	Q2: Given a pcre pattern splitted into string(s) of exact match, should we set a threshold for minimum chars?
		For example: in the pcre pattern: r'/^GateCrasher\s+v\d+\x2E\d+\x2C\s+Server\s+On-Line\x2E\x2E\x2E/ims',
			the exact matches would be: ['GateCrasher', 'v', '.', ',', 'Server', 'On-Line...']. Should single
			char string(s) count? Wouldn't it be too spamy (even if we check 50%+ strings exact matched?).

	Q3a: Given special options in the pcre (i.e., '/ims' for case-insensitivity and more), should we take that into
		consideration when creating the exact match automaton?
		For example: in the pcre patten: r'/GateCrasher/ims' could be any of:
			* gAtEcRashEr, gatecrasHer, GATECRASHeR,...
		We could take that into consideration when implementing the automaton, where for every character,
		if the case-insensitivity was mentioned, we will create every possibility out there? 
	
	Q3b: Regarding to Q3a, given special pcre patterns : o{2} to match exactly 2 times o: 'oo',
		or given o{2,3} to match between 2-3 times 'oo' or 'ooo', or given o{2,} to match *at least* 2 times o.
		Should we only consider the first example (exact match 'oo') or also the others (using the minimal number as exact match).
		For example: o{2} will be exact match 'oo', similarly o{2,} and o{2,500}.
	
	Q4: ASCII vs UTF-8, if we store it as an array of int, what should we use?
		In pcre, \x__ represents UTF-8 symbols, in content |00 00 __ ...| represents UTF-8 as well?
		
	Q5: Are space char(s) exact match? All chars of '\r\n' '\t' and so on...
		When shown alone or when a part of a bigger string(s).
		
	Q6: Similarly to question Q3b, for regex patterns that could be infered in more than one way:
			r'(Login|User)' which can be 'Login' or 'User'
			r'javax?' which can be 'java' or 'javax'
		should we only take "hard" exact match (for the first example none, for the second one 'java')
		or should we also take strings that may or may not appear in a match ('Login', 'User', 'javax').
		And what does it say about "minor" optionals (e.g., '\x00?' which captures NULL escape char or not).
